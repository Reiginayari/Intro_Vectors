    "Our hypothesis states that in the setting of a workplace social network, those who play the important role of knowledge brokers—bridging disparate groups and enabling information flow—will be more eigenvector central than their colleagues. We conducted a social network analysis using an adjacency matrix \n",
    "A to represent connections in a workplace setting, where each node corresponds to an employee. Eigenvector centrality was calculated by solving the equation \n",
    "Ax=λx, where A is the adjacency matrix, x is the eigenvector, and λ is the eigenvalue. According to our data, some members of the workplace network have higher eigenvector centrality, which suggests that they play a crucial role in bridging disparate groupings. This validates our theory, indicating that identifying and nurturing these important linkages may improve internal communication, teamwork, and knowledge exchange.\n"
